Week 1


Will be developing a project using the Sphero as a Microsoft Student Partner.



I will be using Microsoft Azure to connect my iPhone to the Sphero. Then I will be creating an app using Microsoft Visual Studio where a user can play a game with a friend where user 1 would use the Sphero or their camera to tag an object. Then user 2 will need to control the Sphero and locate the object using colors to show how far from the object the Sphero is.



I just got my Sphero in and started to play around with it to see the capabilities of the hardware and see exactly how it functions. It is an interesting little piece of hardware because it is a lot quicker than expected, so I will need to take that into consideration when developing something. Something to also keep in mind is the accuracy of the movement. Which isn't bad, but it does lose accuracy of the user when you move it around too quickly. 

Will keep y'all posted on the progress/research!
